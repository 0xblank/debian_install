#   Debian install

Simple scripts I did to ease my debian installations after too much of them done manually. I made these scripts for debian as it's my OS but I guess they should be usable with debian bases distributions. 

> The docker and the build things are just here for testing purposes.

##  How to use

```
#Â apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/0xblank/debian_install.git
# ./install/entrypoint.sh
```

> The script must be run as with root privileges so it can install packages and everything

You can edit the packages and git_repositories files to install your own packages and git repositories.
