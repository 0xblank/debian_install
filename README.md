Simple scripts I decided to write to automate my linux installations after (way) too many of them done manually.

:warning: **This tool only works for debian based distibutions** :warning:

> The docker and the build things are just here for testing purposes.

This projet was inspired by [exegol](https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol). Awesome project, go check it out !

##  How to use

```
#Â apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/0xblank/linux_install.git
# ./install/entrypoint.sh
```

> The script must be run as with root privileges so it can install packages and everything

You can edit the packages and git_repositories files to install your own packages and git repositories.
